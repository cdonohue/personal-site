### Monetization platform

Developed and maintained a proprietary lead-generation platform to distribute embedded monetization elements across hundreds of sites. I also helped architect a user analytics layer on the server-side to track users across a range of domains and help visualize the conversion funnel of the user journey.

### Styling libraries

Created a [utility styling library](https://github.com/cdonohue/benefit) that was themeable at runtime to adapt to different branding guidelines. This enabled other engineers to iterate faster while building new monetization UI elements.

I also created a [color manipulation library](https://github.com/cdonohue/polychrome) to help with modifying colors at runtime based on theme values. It allowed us to develop generic components that had the ability to meet WCAG contrast requirements for foreground/background color combinations.
