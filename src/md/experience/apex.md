### Fuel card management

Worked with a team of other engineers to design a fuel card management app that allows customers to manage their fuel transactions and locate the nearest fuel locations based on their location.

### Freight factoring

Regular maintenance on proprietary in-house Java application for factoring freight invoices. This involved fixing occassional issues and also developing new features. Some of these added features were: credit bureau integration, automated collection calls, and even an online customer portal for displaying recently scanned images.

Coordinated the re-design of the company web site to be fully responsive for a range of devices and have an enhanced user experience.
