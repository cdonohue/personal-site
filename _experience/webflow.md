### Memberships

Served as tech lead to scope, build, and ship features that allow designers to create complex [membership flows](https://webflow.com/memberships) (sign in, sign up, etc) from a no-code perspective. This project opened up a whole new use case for Webflow built pages including user personalization, paid content, and content gating.

### Platform development

Led a team of engineers and contractors across timezones to successfully migrate hundreds of components within our codebase. This work resulted in the alignment of our code foundation using one set of well-tested APIs and helped pave the way for us to support 3rd party software development within our no-code platform.

### Mentoring

Met with other junior engineers on a weekly basis. Led pairing sessions to help align on best practices and group learning.
